# About
Following along through the JavaScript Design Patterns course on Udacity, I built a simple Cat Clicker that later had two change requirements.

## Project
Build a simple app which consists of a single picture of a cat and a clicker that increments every time the cat picture is clicked.

### Requirement Change 1:
Add another cat with its own clicker

### Requirement Change 2:
Add a list of min 5 cats, when the user clicks on a cat, a picture and a clicker of the cat will display on the side. Each cat has their own picture and clicker.

##Upgrade
The next step with this project is to build it using more organized Javascript in order to make the app scalable.
